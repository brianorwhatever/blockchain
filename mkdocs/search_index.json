And in fact, using a material that has some intrinsic value (outside of being money) can actually be problematic. If you use silver coins, but the price of silver goes up above the value of the coin, then people will just use the coins as bullion and destroy your money supply. When choosing a money, or \u2018medium of exchange\u2019, what matters is that it fulfils the functions we desire from money, and that people trust it.\n\n\nSo, what are the functions of money?\n\n\nThe key functions that a form of money should have if it is going to be useful and have staying power are medium of exchange, unit of account, and store of value:\n\n\nMedium of Exchange\n\n\nThis is the primary job of money and is what makes money, money. Medium of Exchange just means that the money serves as the thing that people trade in place of actual goods. Rather than trading a pair of shoes for a chicken, you trade some money for the chicken. This is a massive gain in terms of ease-of-trade. To be a good medium of exchange a money should be portable, durable, fungible (any dollar is just as good as any other), scarce, and easily divisible.\n\n\nUnit of Account\n\n\nThis is the ability to say a chicken is worth X dollars, a pair of shoes is worth Y dollars, rather than saying a chicken is worth Z pairs of shoes. So all goods and services are priced in terms of a common measure. This is extremely useful in determining how valuable something is in relation to everything else. You can now do all kinds of accounting and economic analysis.\n\n\nStore of Value\n\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\n\nTo act as a store of value, a money must be able to be reliably saved, stored, and retrieved\u2026\n\n\nIt would be nice if the dollars you earned could be held for a long time and then used later.\n\n\nFiat currencies, which are government-backed currencies like the US or Canadian dollar, do a decent job of fulfilling these functions. This is why we use them. That, and the fact that in most countries the law states that taxes, wages etc. must be paid in fiat.\n\n\nIt is important to note that fiat currencies are typically not backed by anything. That is, your Canadian dollar or US dollar is not worth X amount of gold, or anything else for that matter, it is just a unit of currency. Modern money has no intrinsic value whatsoever, and neither do cryptocurrencies, but as long as enough people agree that a money has value, then it has value. As people buy into the idea/delusion that money has value they increasingly accept it in lieu of goods or services and it gains actual value. Money has value to the degree that people believe in it.\n\n\nMoney has been called \u2018the bubble that never pops\u2019 because it is a bubble. The market has assigned great value to something that isn\u2019t intrinsically valuable. But the money bubble doesn\u2019t pop. It actually gets stronger the more \u2018delusional\u2019 people become.\n\n\nSo fiat is widely used, but isn\u2019t actually a perfect medium of exchange. Despite the fact that virtually all our money exists in digital form it is still not easy to send money long distances. Cash works well for in-person exchanges, but sending money across country is costly and difficult, and sending money across borders is slow, expensive, and even more complicated.\n\n\nFiat is also a poor store of value. It\u2019s inflationary for one, so the 1000 dollars in your bank account loses a little value every day. But it is also attached to the parent country\u2019s economy and continued existence. If your country\u2019s economy dips so does your money. If your country\u2019s banking system irresponsibly causes runaway inflation (which has happened many times) your money can become worthless.\n\n\nIf you aren\u2019t confident about the future of your country then you might change some of your fiat into gold, which is a much better store of value. The downside to gold is that it is not a very good medium of exchange. Gold is hard to handle and send, hard to divide precisely, and hard to verify in terms purity.",

            "text": "One of the great advantages of humans organising themselves into groups is specialisation. Rather than each group member dividing their time between gathering food, mending clothing, fashioning tools, and every other task necessary for survival, they could specialise in a few, or even a single task. This provides huge efficiency gains, facilitates technological progress and is generally a good thing.\n\n\nWhen people were in small groups it was relatively easy to keep track of how much work others were doing. If a group member was to share in the food, shelter, and safety of the group, they had better contribute. An individual who failed to contribute would soon be found out and would suffer potentially fatal consequences.\n\n\nThis system of sharing while keeping an eye on individual contribution does not scale though. In order for large-scale societies to form humans would need a new system. Trade came to fill this need.\n\n\nTrade became, among other things, a system for monitoring contribution. Rather than anyone keep track of how many shoes the shoemaker has produced, just let him exchange shoes for whatever he needs. If he wants food he better make shoes, if he wants shelter he just need make more, or higher quality, shoes. If he doesn\u2019t produce then he will not engage in exchange and will simply go without. So the system automatically rewards those who add value and punishes those who do not. This is a market.\n\n\nMarkets are very interesting because they are emergent collective intelligence systems. They extract from the minds of the participants the value of goods and services, and they do so without any necessary leader or governing body. Participants don\u2019t even need to be aware of the concept of a market in order for it to function.\n\n\nIf a market really values salt, then it will assign a high price to salt. People will then go out and find more salt in proportion to the price. If salt demand drops, so does the price, and then fewer people go out to mine it. The market allocates the \u2018correct\u2019 amount of human effort to salt procurement.\n\n\nThe market also indirectly incentivises whatever goes along with obtaining more salt. Salt demand may spawn new technologies, spur exploration, even start wars. But market forces are incredibly powerful. If production of some good causes immense environmental harm, or goes against the wishes of a government, but the market demands it, then it will be produced.\n\n\nSo markets allow people to specialise in large societies and respond dynamically to the priorities of people without organisational overhead. Markets are decentralised, value-signalling, resource-allocating systems.\n\n\nBut the market solution to the large-groups-of-people-specialising problem introduced a bunch of new problems.\n\n\nHow do you keep track of what things are worth? How many chickens is a pair of shoes worth? How many loaves of bread is a metal axe-head worth? Trying to keep track of all these conversions quickly becomes infeasible.\n\n\nFiguring out conversion aside, in order for us to trade we need to have a coincidence of wants. If you make shoes, but all the bakers have good shoes already, how do you get your bread? If a baker wants shoes but you don\u2019t need any bread then he better find another shoemaker who does.\n\n\nAnother issue is that most goods or services are not easily divisible. An axe-head may be worth 20 loaves of bread but you can\u2019t divide the axe-head. And 20 loaves of bread won\u2019t keep before you can eat them all.",

If you use silver coins, but the price of silver goes up above the value of the coin, then people will just use the coins as bullion and destroy your money supply. When choosing a money, or \u2018medium of exchange\u2019, what matters is that it fulfils the functions we desire from money, and that people trust it.\n\n\nSo, what are the functions of money?\n\n\nThe key functions that a form of money should have if it is going to be useful and have staying power are medium of exchange, unit of account, and store of value:\n\n\nMedium of Exchange\n\n\nThis is the primary job of money and is what makes money, money. Medium of Exchange just means that the money serves as the thing that people trade in place of actual goods. Rather than trading a pair of shoes for a chicken, you trade some money for the chicken. This is a massive gain in terms of ease-of-trade. To be a good medium of exchange a money should be portable, durable, fungible (any dollar is just as good as any other), scarce, and easily divisible.\n\n\nUnit of Account\n\n\nThis is the ability to say a chicken is worth X dollars, a pair of shoes is worth Y dollars, rather than saying a chicken is worth Z pairs of shoes. So all goods and services are priced in terms of a common measure. This is extremely useful in determining how valuable something is in relation to everything else. You can now do all kinds of accounting and economic analysis.\n\n\nStore of Value\n\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\n\nTo act as a store of value, a money must be able to be reliably saved, stored, and retrieved\u2026\n\n\nIt would be nice if the dollars you earned could be held for a long time and then used later.\n\n\nFiat currencies, which are government-backed currencies like the US or Canadian dollar, do a decent job of fulfilling these functions. This is why we use them. That, and the fact that in most countries the law states that taxes, wages etc. must be paid in fiat.\n\n\nIt is important to note that fiat currencies are typically not backed by anything. That is, your Canadian dollar or US dollar is not worth X amount of gold, or anything else for that matter, it is just a unit of currency. Modern money has no intrinsic value whatsoever, and neither do cryptocurrencies, but as long as enough people agree that a money has value, then it has value. As people buy into the idea/delusion that money has value they increasingly accept it in lieu of goods or services and it gains actual value. Money has value to the degree that people believe in it.\n\n\nMoney has been called \u2018the bubble that never pops\u2019 because it is a bubble. The market has assigned great value to something that isn\u2019t intrinsically valuable. But the money bubble doesn\u2019t pop. It actually gets stronger the more \u2018delusional\u2019 people become.\n\n\nSo fiat is widely used, but isn\u2019t actually a perfect medium of exchange. Despite the fact that virtually all our money exists in digital form it is still not easy to send money long distances. Cash works well for in-person exchanges, but sending money across country is costly and difficult, and sending money across borders is slow, expensive, and even more complicated.\n\n\nFiat is also a poor store of value. It\u2019s inflationary for one, so the 1000 dollars in your bank account loses a little value every day. But it is also attached to the parent country\u2019s economy and continued existence. If your country\u2019s economy dips so does your money. If your country\u2019s banking system irresponsibly causes runaway inflation (which has happened many times) your money can become worthless.\n\n\nIf you aren\u2019t confident about the future of your country then you might change some of your fiat into gold, which is a much better store of value. The downside to gold is that it is not a very good medium of exchange. Gold is hard to handle and send, hard to divide precisely, and hard to verify in terms purity.",

            "text": "One of the great advantages of humans organising themselves into groups is specialisation. Rather than each group member dividing their time between gathering food, mending clothing, fashioning tools, and every other task necessary for survival, they could specialise in a few, or even a single task. This provides huge efficiency gains, facilitates technological progress and is generally a good thing.\n\n\nWhen people were in small groups it was relatively easy to keep track of how much work others were doing. If a group member was to share in the food, shelter, and safety of the group, they had better contribute. An individual who failed to contribute would soon be found out and would suffer potentially fatal consequences.\n\n\nThis system of sharing while keeping an eye on individual contribution does not scale though. In order for large-scale societies to form humans would need a new system. Trade came to fill this need.\n\n\nTrade became, among other things, a system for monitoring contribution. Rather than anyone keep track of how many shoes the shoemaker has produced, just let him exchange shoes for whatever he needs. If he wants food he better make shoes, if he wants shelter he just need make more, or higher quality, shoes. If he doesn\u2019t produce then he will not engage in exchange and will simply go without. So the system automatically rewards those who add value and punishes those who do not. This is a market.\n\n\nMarkets are very interesting because they are emergent collective intelligence systems. They extract from the minds of the participants the value of goods and services, and they do so without any necessary leader or governing body. Participants don\u2019t even need to be aware of the concept of a market in order for it to function.\n\n\nIf a market really values salt, then it will assign a high price to salt. People will then go out and find more salt in proportion to the price. If salt demand drops, so does the price, and then fewer people go out to mine it. The market allocates the \u2018correct\u2019 amount of human effort to salt procurement.\n\n\nThe market also indirectly incentivises whatever goes along with obtaining more salt. Salt demand may spawn new technologies, spur exploration, even start wars. But market forces are incredibly powerful. If production of some good causes immense environmental harm, or goes against the wishes of a government, but the market demands it, then it will be produced.\n\n\nSo markets allow people to specialise in large societies and respond dynamically to the priorities of people without organisational overhead. Markets are decentralised, value-signalling, resource-allocating systems.\n\n\nBut the market solution to the large-groups-of-people-specialising problem introduced a bunch of new problems.\n\n\nHow do you keep track of what things are worth? How many chickens is a pair of shoes worth? How many loaves of bread is a metal axe-head worth? Trying to keep track of all these conversions quickly becomes infeasible.\n\n\nFiguring out conversion aside, in order for us to trade we need to have a coincidence of wants. If you make shoes, but all the bakers have good shoes already, how do you get your bread? If a baker wants shoes but you don\u2019t need any bread then he better find another shoemaker who does.\n\n\nAnother issue is that most goods or services are not easily divisible. An axe-head may be worth 20 loaves of bread but you can\u2019t divide the axe-head. And 20 loaves of bread won\u2019t keep before you can eat them all.",
