Pay a high fee and your transaction will get in. This is a market.\n\n\nThe decentralised internet will likely use a market system whereby your router routes packets based on the fee that they offer. In high demand periods the price per kilobyte will rise due to demand.\n\n\nGolem will attempt to create a market for computation whereby computers can offer up their resources for a price and buyers (users of that computation) can purchase it.\n\n\nAnywhere some kind of market exists cryptocurrencies may find application, and markets are everywhere.\n\n\nConceptualisation\n\n\nTypically one good/service is not exchanged directly for another, rather they are exchanged for money. So money is the \nmedium of exchange\n for a market. Money allows the market to fluidly operate.\n\n\nMarkets are \ndecentralised, resource allocating systems\n.\n\n\nDecentralisation\n\n\nThey are decentralised in the sense that no one necessarily needs to oversee/control/govern the market in order for it to function. But even without a leader the market can intelligently allocate resources.\n\n\nOur current systems in fact \ndo\n have governing bodies precisely because we can't currently write our laws/rules into the \"code\" that defines the market because most markets exist in the physical world.\n\n\nWith cryptocurrencies we can make truly decentralised markets in the sense that the market rules are solidified into code and no governing body is needed at all to enforce those rules.\n\n\nResource allocation\n\n\nIf the market assigns a high price to some good then people will be incented to obtain/produce more of that good. Material resources as well as human time and effort will be allocated to satisfying this demand in proportion to how highly the market values it.\n\n\nSo a market can be a way for people to collectively orchestrate themselves and direct their efforts toward whatever it is that they value. This is a bottom up approach to human coordination that is \nmuch\n stronger than top down.\n\n\nThe problem up until now is that it has not been possible to actually decide what we want to incentivize and create a market that achieves that. Partly because we can't just define arbitrary market rules and ensure that participants follow them without huge overhead.\n\n\nPrice\n\n\nOne of the things that markets do is price goods/services. The mechanism by which this is done is supply and demand. The market should determine the proper price for a good/service such that the 'correct' amount of effort/resources are allocated to producing it.\n\n\nExternalities\n\n\nSometimes producing a good/service will have some impact on another party that did not necessarily have a say in the exchange. Externalities may be 'unpriced' in the sense that the damage/benefit was not priced in when the transaction happened.\n\n\nThe common example is pollution. Markets demand goods whose production pollutes the environment. People who had no part in the exchange may suffer the consequences of the pollution. It may also cost future generations huge amounts of money to fix. Neither of these were priced into the intial transaction.\n\n\nEfficiency\n\n\nMarkets are efficient in the sense that they price goods, and therefore allocate resources more 'accurately' than any individual or group could manage. If it were up to some group to decide what the 'correct' price of a commodity was, and all sellers had to follow it, they would likely either be too high and consumers would suffer the high price, be unable to buy, and sellers would likely make \nless\n; or price too low and sellers would suffer low profit and production would drop.\n\n\nFree markets\n\n\nA free market is one in which buyers and sellers can establish the proper price for things naturally without government interference. Supply and demand should function properly, and no collusion, monopoly etc. should not take place.",

If some material/medium/system can serve these functions, and gains enough confidence and use, then it is as valid a form of money as any other (though it may or may not be recognized by a government, and may or may not be accepted by a vendor).\n\n\nMedium of Exchange\n\n\nMedium of exchange just means that the money serves as the thing that people trade in place of actual goods. Rather than trading a pair of shoes for a chicken, you trade some money for the chicken. This is a massive gain in terms of ease-of-trade. To be a good medium of exchange a money should be portable, durable, fungible (any dollar is just as good as any other), scarce, and easily divisible.\n\n\nUnit of Account\n\n\nThis is the ability to say a chicken is worth X dollars, a pair of shoes is worth Y dollars, rather than saying a chicken is worth Z pairs of shoes. So all goods and services are priced in terms of a common measure. This is obviously useful in determining how valuable something is in relation to everything else. This allows for all kinds of accounting and economic analysis.\n\n\nStore of Value\n\n\n\n\nTo act as a store of value, a money must be able to be reliably saved, stored, and retrieved\u2026 (Wikipedia)\n\n\n\n\nSo your money should be able to hold value over time and then be used later.\n\n\nFiat\n\n\nFiat is government backed money. Usually a government will make it law that their fiat currency must be used for paying taxes, wages etc. and usually all businesses by law must accept fiat.\n\n\nWe tend to think of fiat as paper money, but something like 90% of the fiat money in circulation only exists as numbers in accounts/databases and has no physical counterpart.\n\n\nFiat has been criticised as being inflationary, and centralised.\n\n\nCentralisation\n\n\nThe amount of fiat that gets produced is controlled either directly by the government or indirectly through a somewhat separate entity like the Federal Reserve. This organisation decides how much money will be produced, by whom, and in what manner (printing cash, fractional lending etc).\n\n\nThis centralisation represents some risk as the controlling organisation may be attacked or become corrupt. They may produce too much money too quickly, and the country could suffer hyper-inflation. This has happened in Austria, China, Germany, Greece, Zimbabwe and many other countries.\n\n\nInflation\n\n\nThe US and Canada aim for something like 2% annual inflation. What this means is that if there is a total of \nX\n Canadian dollars in circulation right now, then one year from now there will be \nX*1.02\n total dollars in circulation. So the total supply of money is increasing constantly.\n\n\nIf you keep your money in a savings account you might get \n.25%\n interest or something like that, much less than the rate of inflation. So your money is devalued annually (relative to the total supply) by \n1.75%\n.\n\n\nOne way to look at this is that 1.75% of the value of your money is skimmed off every year and sent to the banks or whoever is issuing the new money.\n\n\nHyperinflation\n\n\nHyperinflation occurs when, for whatever reason, the rate of inflation gets completely out of control.\n\n\nMaybe the most well known example is in Zimbabwe where the Zimbabwe dollar (ZWL) went from:\n\n\n1.25 ZWL = 1 USD\n\n\n\n\nto:\n\n\n688,000,000,000 ZWL = 1 USD\n\n\n\n\nThey had \n100 trillion\n dollar bills!",

The sig is unique to that transaction. The sig is a big number.\n\n\nNow other nodes can see the message (send X BTC to whoever), see your address (your pub key) and see your signature for that transaction.

Therefore they have some aspect of time encoded into them.\n\n\nBasic idea\n\n\nTake some chunk or 'block' of data, compute the hash for it, now take that hash value and put it in the next block. Repeat the process for each new block. Now anyone who looks at this sequence of blocks can be sure of their order of creation, as well as the contents of each block being unaltered in any way after the chain was created.\n\n\nAssuming the hash of at least the newest block is published somewhere trusted, then if an attacker tries to send you a copy of the blockchain with even a single bit changed in \nany\n block, no matter how far back, the hashes of all blocks following the change will not match.\n\n\nIn addition to the previous block's hash, a block can contain any kind of data you want. In the case of Bitcoin the blocks contain transaction data. Attackers cannot go back to an old block and change a transaction, because doing so would cause all following block hashes to change. A blockchain could be made to store contracts, records of events, patents or anything else where having an unaltered history matters.\n\n\nThis data structure can serve as a sort of shared database. It would be nice however, to have some way of knowing your blockchain, your database, was correct without having to trust a hash value from \nanyone\n.
