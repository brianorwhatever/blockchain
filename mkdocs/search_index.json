Pay a high fee and your transaction will get in. \n\n\nThe decentralised internet will likely use a market system whereby your router routes packets based on the fee that they offer. In high demand periods the price per kilobyte will rise due to demand.\n\n\nConceptualisation\n\n\nTypically one good/service is not exchanged directly for another, rather they are exchanged for money. So money is the \nmedium of exchange\n for a market. Money allows the market to fluidly operate.\n\n\nMarkets are decentralised, resource allocating systems.\n\n\nDecentralisation\n\n\nThey are decentralised in the sense that no one needs to oversee/control/govern the market in order for it to function. But even without a leader the market can intelligently allocate resources.\n\n\nResource allocation\n\n\nIf the market assigns a high price to some good then people will be incented obtain/produce more of that good. Material resources as well as human time and effort will be allocated to satisfying this demand in proportion to how highly the market values it.\n\n\nSo a market is a way for people to collectively orchestrate themselves and direct their efforts toward whatever it is that they value.\n\n\nPrice\n\n\nOne of the things that markets do is price goods/services. The mechanism by which this is done is supply and demand. The market should determine the proper price for a good/service such that the 'correct' amount of effort/resources are allocated to producing it.\n\n\nExternalities\n\n\nSometimes producing a good/service will have some impact on another party that did not necessarily have a say in the exchange. Externalities may be 'unpriced' in the sense that the damage/benefit was not priced in when the transaction happened.\n\n\nThe common example is pollution. Markets demand goods whose production pollutes the environment. People who had no part in the exchange may suffer the consequences of the pollution. It may also cost future generations huge amounts of money to fix. Neither of these were priced into the intial transaction.\n\n\nEfficiency\n\n\nMarkets are efficient in the sense that they price goods, and therefore allocate resources more 'accurately' than any individual or group could manage.\n\n\nFree markets\n\n\nA free market is one in which buyers and sellers can establish the proper price for things naturally without government interference. Supply and demand should function properly, and no collusion, monopoly etc. should take place.",

Rather than trading a pair of shoes for a chicken, you trade some money for the chicken. This is a massive gain in terms of ease-of-trade. To be a good medium of exchange a money should be portable, durable, fungible (any dollar is just as good as any other), scarce, and easily divisible.\n\n\nUnit of Account\n\n\nThis is the ability to say a chicken is worth X dollars, a pair of shoes is worth Y dollars, rather than saying a chicken is worth Z pairs of shoes. So all goods and services are priced in terms of a common measure. This is extremely useful in determining how valuable something is in relation to everything else. This allows for all kinds of accounting and economic analysis.\n\n\nStore of Value\n\n\n\n\nTo act as a store of value, a money must be able to be reliably saved, stored, and retrieved\u2026 (Wikipedia)\n\n\n\n\nIt would be nice if the dollars you earned could be held for a long time and then used later.\n\n\nFiat\n\n\nFiat is government backed money. Usually a government will make it law that their fiat currency must be used for paying taxes, wages etc. and usually all businesses by law must accept fiat.\n\n\nWe tend to think of fiat as paper money, but something like 90% of the fiat money in circulation only exists as numbers in accounts/databases and has no physical counterpart.\n\n\nFiat has been criticised as being inflationary, and centralised.\n\n\nCentralisation\n\n\nThe amount of fiat that gets produced is controlled directly by the government or by a sort of separate entity like the Federal Reserve. This organisation decides how much money will be produced, by whom, and in what manner.\n\n\nThis represents some risk as the controlling organisation may become corrupt, produce too much money too quickly, and the country may suffer hyper-inflation. This has happened in Austria, China, Germany, Greece, Zimbabwe and many other countries.\n\n\nInflation\n\n\nThe US and Canada aim for something like 2% annual inflation. What this means is that if there is a total of X Canadian dollars in circulation right now, then one year from now there will be X*1.02 total dollars in circulation.

So your money has become devalued (relative to the total supply) by 1.75%. \n\n\nOne way to look at this is that 1.75% of the value of your money is skimmed off every year and sent to the banks or whoever is issuing the new money.\n\n\nHyperinflation\n\n\nHyperinflation occurs when, for whatever reason, the rate of inflation gets completely out of control.\n\n\nMaybe the most well known example is in Zimbabwe where they went from about 1.25 ZWR (Zimbabwe dollar)= 1 USD, to 688 billion ZWM = 1 USD.

So whether your input is 1 bit or 1 billion bits the output will be the same size.\n\n\nA given input will always map to the same output, and the output should appear completely random. The SHA-256 hash algorithm for example produces a 256-bit output. Therefore any given hash value is one of 2\n256\n possible outputs.

If their copy of the file has been altered in any way, even if just one bit is flipped, the hash value will not match. If the hash matches then the user can be sure their file is legit. This sort of independent integrity check is much better than going through the file chunk by chunk and asking the server if each chunk is correct.\n\n\nHash lists\n\n\nThis concept can be extended to \nhash lists\n to allow trustless peer to peer file sharing. Take a file, break it up into many small pieces. Hash each piece. Publish this relatively small hash list somewhere trusted. Now a peer in the network can accept a file piece from anyone, hash it, if the hash is found in the list then keep the piece, else discard.
