They are also used all over the place in computer science, and are pretty amazing little pieces of digital machinery.\n\n\nDefinition\n\n\nCryptographic hash functions are one-way functions that map data of arbitrary size to some fixed-size output. So whether your input is 1 bit or 1 billion bits the output will be the same size.\n\n\nA hash function can be viewed as a black box, where given some input like the example below, the output is fixed-size, and random looking.\n\n\nExample\n\n\nGiven the string:\n\n\nhello\n\n\n\n\nThe SHA-256 hash algorithm will output:\n\n\n0x2cf24dba5fb0a30e26e83b2ac5b9e29e1b161e5c1fa7425e73043362938b9824\n\n\n\n\nGiven the entirety of Wikipedia as input, the output would be the same size, but the characters would be different.\n\n\nNote: Bitcoin uses SHA-256 in it's mining algorithm. Also, it's called SHA-256 because it outputs 256 bits.\n\n\nProperties of an Ideal Hash Function\n\n\n\n\nDeterminism\n: the same message always produces the same output\n\n\nQuickness\n: it is quick to compute the hash for some input\n\n\nIrreversibility\n: given some hash you can't figure out what the input was except by randomly guessing it and hashing the guess to see if it matches the target hash (the universe would end before you succeeded)\n\n\nAvalanche effect\n: even a small change to the input completely alters the output\n\n\nCollision resistance\n: it is infeasible to find two messages that hash to the same value (sun explodes before you succeed)\n\n\n\n\nSo given these properties, what good are they?\n\n\nApplications\n\n\nDigital Fingerprinting\n\n\nThe simplest application is \ndigital fingerprinting\n. Take some chunk of data and hash it. The hash value will be unique to that document.\n\n\nExample\n\n\nSuppose the Ubuntu website wants to let people download the Ubuntu image file.\n\n\nThey can offer the download on the site, but also publish the hash of it.\n\n\nUsers can then download the file, and hash it themselves using the same algorithm. If their hash matches the published one then every single bit in their file matches exactly the official file.\n\n\nThat way they user knows the file wasn't altered in transit, or some virus on their computer didn't inject anything after it downloaded. The user could also download the file from any site, even an untrusted one. If they hash it and it matches the published hash then their file is legit.\n\n\nHash lists\n\n\nThis concept can be extended to \nhash lists\n to allow trustless peer to peer file sharing.\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\nTake a file, perhaps a movie, break it up into many small pieces.\n\n\nHash each piece.\n\n\nPublish this relatively small list of hashes somewhere trusted. \n\n\nNow a peer in the network can accept a file piece from anyone, hash it; if the hash is found in the list then keep the piece, else discard.\n\n\n\n\nAn attacker cannot create a malicious file piece that matches a hash in the list. It's just too hard to find something that hashes to one of those hashes in the list, except the actual file piece. \n\n\nThis is basically what Bittorrent does.\n\n\nImprovement\n\n\nEven better we could hash the \nhash-list itself\n to get a master-hash or 'top-hash'.\n\n\nWe can then just publish the top-hash and allow the peers to share hash-lists. When a peer sends you the hash-list, hash it, check if it matches the published top-hash. If it matches then the hash-list you were given is legit and you can use it to start accepting blocks.",

Here is a simplified explanation of what happens:\n\n\n\n\nUse wallet software to generate a key-pair. A key-pair consists of a public and private key. The public key is your 'account number', or address, and can be shared. The private key is the key that unlocks your money.\n\n\nGet some Bitcoin in that account.\n\n\nUse your wallet softare to create a transaction. This transaction will say 'send X BTC to (your address)'. The transaction will include your address.\n\n\nSign the transaction. To sign it take the message and your private key and do crypto magic to produce a signature. The sig is unique to that transaction. The sig is a big number.\n\n\nNow other nodes can see the message (send X BTC to whoever), see your address (your pub key) and see your signature for that transaction.

If some material/medium/system can serve these functions, and gains enough confidence and use, then it is in principle as valid a form of money as any other.\n\n\nMedium of Exchange\n\n\nMedium of exchange just means that the money serves as the thing that people trade in place of actual goods. \n\n\nTo be a good medium of exchange a money should be portable, durable, fungible (any dollar is just as good as any other), scarce, and easily divisible.\n\n\nExample\n\n\nRather than trading a pair of shoes for a chicken, you trade some money for the chicken and everyone else does the same.\n\n\nUnit of Account\n\n\nPrice everything in units of the money. So all goods and services are priced in terms of a common measure.\n\n\nExample\n\n\nThis is the ability to say a chicken is worth X dollars, a pair of shoes is worth Y dollars, rather than saying a chicken is worth Z pairs of shoes. \n\n\nStore of Value\n\n\n\n\nTo act as a store of value, a money must be able to be reliably saved, stored, and retrieved\u2026 (Wikipedia)\n\n\n\n\nSo your money should be able to hold value over time and then be used later.\n\n\nExample\n\n\nGold is good for store of value. Gold doesn't evaporate away and the supply doesn't inflate too much. People have valued it for thousands of years so it will probably remain valuable in 10 years or 50.\n\n\nFiat\n\n\nFiat is government-backed money. Usually a government will make it law that their fiat currency must be used for paying taxes, wages etc. and usually all businesses by law must accept fiat.\n\n\nWe tend to think of fiat as paper money, but something like 90% of the fiat money in circulation only exists as numbers in accounts/databases and has no physical counterpart. The digital portion still counts as being part of the same fiat supply.\n\n\nFiat has been criticised as being inflationary, and centralised.\n\n\nCentralisation\n\n\nThe amount of fiat that gets produced is controlled either directly by the government or kinda indirectly through a kinda separate entity like the Federal Reserve. \n\n\nThis organisation decides how much money will be produced, by whom, and in what manner (printing cash, \nfractional lending\n, etc).\n\n\nThis centralisation represents some risk as the controlling organisation may be attacked or become corrupt. They may produce too much money too quickly, and the country could suffer hyper-inflation. This has happened in Austria, China, Germany, Greece, Zimbabwe and many other countries.\n\n\nInflation\n\n\nThe US and Canada aim for something like 2% annual inflation. What this means is that if there is a total of \nX\n Canadian dollars in circulation right now, then one year from now there will be \nX*1.02\n total dollars in circulation. So the total supply of money is increasing constantly.\n\n\nIf you keep your money in a savings account you might get \n.25%\n interest or something like that, much less than the rate of inflation. So your money is devalued annually (relative to the total supply) by \n1.75%\n.\n\n\nOne way to look at this is that 1.75% of the value of your money is skimmed off every year and sent to the banks or whoever is issuing the new money.\n\n\nHyperinflation\n\n\nHyperinflation occurs when, for whatever reason, the rate of inflation gets completely out of control.\n\n\nMaybe the most well known example is in Zimbabwe where the Zimbabwe dollar (ZWL) went from:\n\n\n1.25 ZWL = 1 USD\n\n\n\n\nto:\n\n\n688,000,000,000 ZWL = 1 USD\n\n\n\n\nThey had \n100 trillion\n dollar bills!",
