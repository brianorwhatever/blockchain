If some material/medium/system can serve these functions and gains enough confidence and use, then it is as valid a form of money as any other.\n\n\nMedium of Exchange\n\n\nMedium of exchange just means that the money serves as the thing that people trade in place of actual goods. Rather than trading a pair of shoes for a chicken, you trade some money for the chicken. This is a massive gain in terms of ease-of-trade. To be a good medium of exchange a money should be portable, durable, fungible (any dollar is just as good as any other), scarce, and easily divisible.\n\n\nUnit of Account\n\n\nThis is the ability to say a chicken is worth X dollars, a pair of shoes is worth Y dollars, rather than saying a chicken is worth Z pairs of shoes. So all goods and services are priced in terms of a common measure. This is extremely useful in determining how valuable something is in relation to everything else. This allows for all kinds of accounting and economic analysis.\n\n\nStore of Value\n\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\n\nTo act as a store of value, a money must be able to be reliably saved, stored, and retrieved\u2026\n\n\nIt would be nice if the dollars you earned could be held for a long time and then used later.\n\n\n\n\nFiat\n\n\nFiat is government backed money. Usually a government will make it law that their fiat currency must be used for paying taxes, wages etc. and usually all businesses by law must accept fiat.\n\n\nWe tend to think of fiat as paper money, but something like 90% of the fiat money in circulation only exists as numbers in accounts/databases and has no physical counterpart.\n\n\nFiat has been criticised as being inflationary, and centralised.\n\n\nCentralisation\n\n\nThe amount of fiat that gets produced is controlled directly by the government or by a sort of separate entity like the Federal Reserve. This organisation decides how much money will be produced, by whom, and in what manner.\n\n\nThis represents some risk as the controlling organisation may become corrupt, produce too much money too quickly, and the country may suffer hyper-inflation. This has happened in Austria, China, Germany, Greece, Zimbabwe and many other countries.\n\n\nInflation\n\n\nThe US and Canada aim for something like 2% annual inflation. What this means is that if there is a total of X Canadian dollars in circulation right now, then one year from now there will be X*1.02 total dollars in circulation. So the total supply of money is increasing constantly.\n\n\nIf you keep your money in a savings account you might get .25% interest or something like that, much less than the rate of inflation. So your money has become devalued (relative to the total supply) by 1.75%. \n\n\nOne way to look at this is that 1.75% of the value of your money is skimmed off every year and sent to the banks or whoever is issuing the new money.\n\n\nHyperinflation\n\n\nHyperinflation occurs when, for whatever reason, the rate of inflation gets completely out of control.\n\n\nMaybe the most well known example is in Zimbabwe where they went from about 1.25 ZWR (Zimbabwe dollar)= 1 USD, to 688 billion ZWM = 1 USD. They had trillion dollar bills!",

Rather than trading a pair of shoes for a chicken, you trade some money for the chicken. This is a massive gain in terms of ease-of-trade.

One way to look at this is that 1.75% of the value of your money is skimmed off every year and sent to the banks or whoever is issuing the new money.",
