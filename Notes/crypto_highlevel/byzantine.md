[![Byzantine Generals](http://img.youtube.com/vi/kE51N84hBxU/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/kE51N84hBxU)

Suppose an army splits into two in order to surround a city. Each army has a general.

The generals must communicate by messenger and they must decide on what day they will attack.

If they attack on the same day they will take the city. If they attack on different days they will be defeated.

Unfortunately the messenger cannot be trusted. He could be intercepted/corrupted in transit.

So there is a consensus problem. How do the general arrive at consensus when they must use a unreliable communication channel?
