> A market is one of the many varieties of systems, institutions, procedures, social relations and infrastructures whereby parties engage in exchange (Wikipedia)

Markets are very much relevant to cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin miners choose which transactions to include in their block based on the fees associated with the transactions. Pay a high fee and your transaction will get in. 

The decentralised internet will likely use a market system whereby your router routes packets based on the fee that they offer. In high demand periods the price per kilobyte will rise due to demand.

## Conceptualisation

Typically one good/service is not exchanged directly for another, rather they are exchanged for money. So money is the *medium of exchange* for a market. Money allows the market to fluidly operate.

Markets are decentralised, resource allocating systems.

### Decentralisation

They are decentralised in the sense that no one needs to oversee/control/govern the market in order for it to function. But even without a leader the market can intelligently allocate resources.

### Resource allocation

If the market assigns a high price to some good then people will be incented obtain/produce more of that good. Material resources as well as human time and effort will be allocated to satisfying this demand in proportion to how highly the market values it.

So a market is a way for people to collectively orchestrate themselves and direct their efforts toward whatever it is that they value.

## Price

One of the things that markets do is price goods/services. The mechanism by which this is done is supply and demand. The market should determine the proper price for a good/service such that the 'correct' amount of effort/resources are allocated to producing it.

## Externalities

Sometimes producing a good/service will have some impact on another party that did not necessarily have a say in the exchange. Externalities may be 'unpriced' in the sense that the damage/benefit was not priced in when the transaction happened.

The common example is pollution. Markets demand goods whose production pollutes the environment. People who had no part in the exchange may suffer the consequences of the pollution. It may also cost future generations huge amounts of money to fix. Neither of these were priced into the intial transaction.

## Efficiency

Markets are efficient in the sense that they price goods, and therefore allocate resources more 'accurately' than any individual or group could manage.

## Free markets

A free market is one in which buyers and sellers can establish the proper price for things naturally without government interference. Supply and demand should function properly, and no collusion, monopoly etc. should take place.
