## Conceptualisation

Ultimately a blockchain is a type of database.

Like any database you can store whatever you want in it, but blockchains have some unique properties.

## How they work

[This](https://youtu.be/_160oMzblY8) video visually explains how blockchains work far better than I could explain in written form so I won't try.

## Structure
Blockchains are append only.

The name 'blockchain' gives a great visual of their structure. It's a long chain of blocks where each block contains whatever data you want. Blocks get added onto the end of the chain, but you can never go back and change anything in older blocks.

If you were to change something a few blocks back then it would alter every subsequent block and everyone would immediately see that something had changed.
