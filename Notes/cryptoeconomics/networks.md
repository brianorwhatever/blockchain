Many apsects of human organisation and cooperation can be viewed as networks. Human society can be viewed as a collection of overlapping networks.

Naval Ravikant talks about this idea quite a bit. Check [this](https://hackernoon.com/reflections-on-the-best-blockchain-tweets-ever-written-d488af960d4f) post for some exposition on some of his views.

### Examples
All the people using a particular form of money make up a network. All the people participating in an economy make up a network. The residents of a city or country make up a network. These networks obviously overlap quite a bit.

The people involved in the iPhone supply chain form a network by virtue of their all contributing to that one product. But many of those people also work to produce other products, so they are also part of those networks as well.

The cars on road system constitute a network, the internet connected computers of the world make up a network (the internet). And so on.

These networks are systems of human organisation, and are incredibly useful.

## Better Networks
One of the great challenges of human history has been to build better, more efficient, more sophisticated networks.

There are many ways to improve the functioning of a network. Better communication between participants may be of great benefit. Improving the effectiveness of individuals within the network no doubt makes the network more effective.

Another way to not only improve the functioning of a given network but also enable entirely new, previously untenable networks to form, is to come up with a better medium/structure/framework within which to define and enforce network rules.

Our existing networks have their rules defined very loosely by a collection of laws, regulations, and agreements. These mechanisms are costly to maintain, imprecise, and often easily subverted.

### Cryptoeconomics
The promise of Cryptoeconomics is networks/systems for which the rules are absolute and enforced with little or no overhead.

Since networks are **everywhere** and most of them function pretty poorly the potential here cannot be overstated.
