## Money
**Bitcoin**

The original cryptocurrency. Biggest market cap of all. Lots of community drama, slow to evolve. Capped at 21 million coins.

**Litecoin**

A Bitcoin fork. Much quicker block time. More efficient blockchain in terms of storage space required. Capped at 84 million coins.

**Dash**

Focused on privacy. Supposedly solid dev team, Evolution update promising to make it easiest to use.

**Monero**

‘Most private’. Fungible, untraceable. New update will mean your ISP cannot know you are using it. Different codebase than BTC. Sounds like the best for privacy. Addresses are not public. Tx amounts not public. Dyanmic block size. Quick tx.

**ZCash**

'If bitcoin is http, zcash is https'. Uses zero knowledge proofs. Fork of bitcoin. Deflationary. 2.5 min block time. Uses modified proof of work, memory hard proof of work. 2 MB blocksize. Founders can potentially inflate the supply secretly since it’s all encrypted.

## Computing
**Ethereum**

Global, distributed trustless general computer. Can build currencies on top of it, or just about anything else.

**Tezos**

Like ethereum but not Turing complete. Big emphasis on governance being built into the protocol. Strongly typed language Ocamel.

**Golem**

Distributed computing framework. Will allow computers/nodes to sell their computing power in a market. Possible difficulties in anonymizing the computing work sent to the nodes.

## Communications
**Status**

Wallet/browser/chat-app for ethereum. Chat with people, exchange money with them. Purchase things I assume. Also apply for job and share your credentials. No middleman. Also make small purchases like coffee.

## Storage
**IPFS**

Interplanetary File Storage. 'A peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol to make the web faster, safer, and more open.'

Each file and all the blocks in it are hashed. Duplication is reduced/removed. When requesting a file you ask the network to find the files corresponding to some hash.

**Sia**

Decentralised storage. Breaks files into chunks, encrypts, distributes. Aiming to replace dropbox/s3. Anyone can make siacoin by renting out hdd. Claimed storage cost of $2/TB/month. Multi-region redundancy.

**Storj**

Same as sia I think.

## Organization
**Factom**

Aimed at the problem in many industries of proof of record. If you issue land titles you want to be able to prove that the title existed at X date. Basically they are a layer on bitcoin block chain and provide a sort of api to businesses where they can have their backend software tie into Factom and get reliable timestamps on arbitrary documents. This could be any data including music etc. May be used for patents, copyright or anything else.

Fee per entrant into their ecosystem. People seem very bullish on it. Japan using it? Apparently some real business interest going on.

**Aragon**

Emphasis on organisation. New way to build a company/organisation?

## Prediction Markets

**Augur**

'If Bitcoin gave us decentralized currency and Ethereum brought decentralized computation, Augur will enable a decentralized financial system'.

**Gnosis**

Prediction market with a defective oracle as last resort for settling markets.

## Finance
**Ripple**

Made for use by banks. For inter-bank funds transfer? Pre-mined. Fairly centralised. Bearish long term?

**Numerai**

Bet on your ML stock picking model with numerai and someone wins each week or month or w/e. Uses Numerai token.

## Media
**Brave**

Uses Basic Attention Token. Will use Brave browser made by guy who invented JS. Seems legit. Seems to have interest from various parties.
