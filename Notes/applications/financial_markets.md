> A financial market is a market in which people trade financial securities, commodities, and other fungible items of value at low transaction costs and at prices that reflect supply and demand. Securities include stocks and bonds, and commodities include precious metals or agricultural products.
Moving financial markets onto Ethereum or a similar platform can not only be done relatively easily, but the gains in efficiency, security, and cost savings could be worth billions of dollars.

1. Tokenize the asset/stock/bond
2. Transfer ownership to existing owners
3. Replicate buy/sell features via Ethereum smart contracts

Before this can actually be done however the Ethereum transactions per second will need to increase.
