## Self-Driving Cars
Self-driving cars could become self-operating, self-owning. The car would be managed by a smart contract on ethereum or something.

The fleet could be profitless or could perhaps take some profit in order to expand the fleet.

The stock market is a place to buy/sell shares of companies. These shares can, and likely will become tokenized. Once they are tokenized the whole stock market can function without intermediary.
