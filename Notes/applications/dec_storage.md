The same system would exist for storage. Computers could offer their storage space for 'mining' purposes. And of course you could have your machine intelligently use the extra space to make you money. It too would be a market. Though perhaps you would agree to store a file for 24h or something and not just drop everything if prices go up for some new data.

So files would flow through the system like a fluid. If a bunch of people in an area are demanding the same video file you don't want to have to keep sending it from the source, if the source if far away. What you want is to have the file only come in from the source once, get stored on some harddrives, then serve from there as demand increases. You basically want to never have to go backward. So if anyone near me gets the file I get it from them.

There will be great algorithmic improvements made to this system. This will be an area where hard computer science will be able to make huge efficiency gains. 

So we can decentralise networking.
