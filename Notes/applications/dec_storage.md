## Unused Storage
Similar to how a large percentage of the world's computing resources are sitting idle at any given time, a large portion of the world's storage is unused.

Filecoin, Sia and Storj are all attempting to build platforms for decentralised storage markets.

## Mining
'Miners' will be able to earn the coin corresponding to the network by renting out their harddrive space. They may also be paid more depending on how quickly they can respond to a request for a piece of a file.

## Buying
Users who wish to store files on the network will perhaps be able to choose a availabilty-tier where users needing high availabilty would pay more per TB.

## Privacy
Files can be broken up into chunks, encrypted and then distributed across the network. Files chunks would also likely be replicated across nodes so that if some nodes fail or become unavailable, the file can still be retrieved.
