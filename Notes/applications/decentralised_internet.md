The current Internet is has a layer of 'thin' protocols like TCP/IP, and then on top of those there are 'fat' clients.

the future Internet will have fat protocols and thin clients.

**Example**
If I want to watch a YouTube video on my phone I make a request to some YouTube server 100's or 1000's of km's away.

If the person standing next to me wants to watch the same video they go through the same process despite the fact that I have the video.

This can be mitigated somewhat by CDNs, but the Internet will always be inefficient as long as it is centralised.

The same idea applies for the entire Internet because the Internet is centralised. Obviously the Internet works, so it's not the worst system imaginable. But it could become massively more efficient if it were decentralised.
