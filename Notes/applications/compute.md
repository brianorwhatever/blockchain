## Idle Computing Resources
Some decent percentage of the world's computing power at any given time is stting idle doing nothing. This is especially true for personal computing devices. If you have a laptop or desktop computer that you use for 6 hours a day, it might be under full load for less than an hour (probably much less), most of the time it will be at 5% or so utilization. Then for the other 18 hours of the day it is at 0%.

Just like Uber/AirBnB created a market to connect under-utilized resources to buyers, projects like Golem may create a market for under-utilized computing resources.

## Limitations
Tasks with an emphasis on speed are not likely to be good candidates for distributed computing as network speeds will always be non-zero, and there is compute overhead to distributing a task.

Tasks that contain sensitive information will need to be hidden somehow from the user of the machine. If this is not possible then the usefulness of such a network will be hindered.

## Use Cases
On the other hand, tasks that may take hours on a normal machine are good candidates for distributed computing. Especially tasks are easily parallelizable of course.

Graphic intensive tasks like rendering video are probably the best use case today.

## Mining
Uses who want to earn some extra money will be able to run a client that sells the machines compute power for the highest price it can manage.

## Buying
Users of the network will be able to specify how much they are willing to pay to get a job done. If they want it done quickly they pay more. If they are not in a rush they can set a low fee and the job will be done when there is low demand on the network.
