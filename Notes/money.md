The key functions of money are *medium of exchange*, *unit of account*, and *store of value*. If some material/medium/system can serve these functions and gains enough confidence and use, then it is as valid a form of money as any other.

## Medium of Exchange

Medium of exchange just means that the money serves as the thing that people trade in place of actual goods. Rather than trading a pair of shoes for a chicken, you trade some money for the chicken. This is a massive gain in terms of ease-of-trade. To be a good medium of exchange a money should be portable, durable, fungible (any dollar is just as good as any other), scarce, and easily divisible.

## Unit of Account

This is the ability to say a chicken is worth X dollars, a pair of shoes is worth Y dollars, rather than saying a chicken is worth Z pairs of shoes. So all goods and services are priced in terms of a common measure. This is extremely useful in determining how valuable something is in relation to everything else. This allows for all kinds of accounting and economic analysis.

## Store of Value

From Wikipedia:

To act as a store of value, a money must be able to be reliably saved, stored, and retrievedâ€¦

It would be nice if the dollars you earned could be held for a long time and then used later.

## Fiat

Fiat is government backed money. Usually a government will make it law that their fiat currency must be used for paying taxes, wages etc. and usually all businesses by law must accept fiat.

We tend to think of fiat as paper money, but something like 90% of the fiat money in circulation only exists as numbers in accounts/databases and has no physical counterpart.

Fiat has been criticised as being inflationary, and centralised.

### Centralisation

The amount of fiat that gets produced is controlled directly by the government or by a sort of separate entity like the Federal Reserve. This organisation decides how much money will be produced, by whom, and in what manner.

This represents some risk as the controlling organisation may become corrupt, produce too much money too quickly, and the country may suffer hyper-inflation. This has happened in Austria, China, Germany, Greece, Zimbabwe and many other countries.

### Inflation

The US and Canada aim for something like 2% annual inflation. What this means is that if there is a total of X Canadian dollars in circulation right now, then one year from now there will be X*1.02 total dollars in circulation. So the total supply of money is increasing constantly.

If you keep your money in a savings account you might get .25% interest or something like that, much less than the rate of inflation. So your money has become devalued (relative to the total supply) by 1.75%. 

One way to look at this is that 1.75% of the value of your money is skimmed off every year and sent to the banks or whoever is issuing the new money.

### Hyperinflation

Hyperinflation occurs when, for whatever reason, the rate of inflation gets completely out of control.

Maybe the most well known example is in Zimbabwe where they went from about 1.25 ZWR (Zimbabwe dollar)= 1 USD, to 688 billion ZWM = 1 USD. They had trillion dollar bills!
