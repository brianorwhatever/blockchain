The specific material used to play the role of money isn’t actually that important. And in fact, using a material that has some intrinsic value (outside of being money) can actually be problematic. If you use silver coins, but the price of silver goes up above the value of the coin, then people will just use the coins as bullion and destroy your money supply. When choosing a money, or ‘medium of exchange’, what matters is that it fulfils the functions we desire from money, and that people trust it.

So, what are the functions of money?

The key functions that a form of money should have if it is going to be useful and have staying power are medium of exchange, unit of account, and store of value:

## Medium of Exchange

This is the primary job of money and is what makes money, money. Medium of Exchange just means that the money serves as the thing that people trade in place of actual goods. Rather than trading a pair of shoes for a chicken, you trade some money for the chicken. This is a massive gain in terms of ease-of-trade. To be a good medium of exchange a money should be portable, durable, fungible (any dollar is just as good as any other), scarce, and easily divisible.

## Unit of Account

This is the ability to say a chicken is worth X dollars, a pair of shoes is worth Y dollars, rather than saying a chicken is worth Z pairs of shoes. So all goods and services are priced in terms of a common measure. This is extremely useful in determining how valuable something is in relation to everything else. You can now do all kinds of accounting and economic analysis.

## Store of Value

From Wikipedia:

To act as a store of value, a money must be able to be reliably saved, stored, and retrieved…

It would be nice if the dollars you earned could be held for a long time and then used later.

Fiat currencies, which are government-backed currencies like the US or Canadian dollar, do a decent job of fulfilling these functions. This is why we use them. That, and the fact that in most countries the law states that taxes, wages etc. must be paid in fiat.

It is important to note that fiat currencies are typically not backed by anything. That is, your Canadian dollar or US dollar is not worth X amount of gold, or anything else for that matter, it is just a unit of currency. Modern money has no intrinsic value whatsoever, and neither do cryptocurrencies, but as long as enough people agree that a money has value, then it has value. As people buy into the idea/delusion that money has value they increasingly accept it in lieu of goods or services and it gains actual value. Money has value to the degree that people believe in it.

Money has been called ‘the bubble that never pops’ because it is a bubble. The market has assigned great value to something that isn’t intrinsically valuable. But the money bubble doesn’t pop. It actually gets stronger the more ‘delusional’ people become.

So fiat is widely used, but isn’t actually a perfect medium of exchange. Despite the fact that virtually all our money exists in digital form it is still not easy to send money long distances. Cash works well for in-person exchanges, but sending money across country is costly and difficult, and sending money across borders is slow, expensive, and even more complicated.

Fiat is also a poor store of value. It’s inflationary for one, so the 1000 dollars in your bank account loses a little value every day. But it is also attached to the parent country’s economy and continued existence. If your country’s economy dips so does your money. If your country’s banking system irresponsibly causes runaway inflation (which has happened many times) your money can become worthless.

If you aren’t confident about the future of your country then you might change some of your fiat into gold, which is a much better store of value. The downside to gold is that it is not a very good medium of exchange. Gold is hard to handle and send, hard to divide precisely, and hard to verify in terms purity.
