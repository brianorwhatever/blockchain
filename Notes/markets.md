One of the great advantages of humans organising themselves into groups is specialisation. Rather than each group member dividing their time between gathering food, mending clothing, fashioning tools, and every other task necessary for survival, they could specialise in a few, or even a single task. This provides huge efficiency gains, facilitates technological progress and is generally a good thing.

When people were in small groups it was relatively easy to keep track of how much work others were doing. If a group member was to share in the food, shelter, and safety of the group, they had better contribute. An individual who failed to contribute would soon be found out and would suffer potentially fatal consequences.

This system of sharing while keeping an eye on individual contribution does not scale though. In order for large-scale societies to form humans would need a new system. Trade came to fill this need.

Trade became, among other things, a system for monitoring contribution. Rather than anyone keep track of how many shoes the shoemaker has produced, just let him exchange shoes for whatever he needs. If he wants food he better make shoes, if he wants shelter he just need make more, or higher quality, shoes. If he doesn’t produce then he will not engage in exchange and will simply go without. So the system automatically rewards those who add value and punishes those who do not. This is a market.

Markets are very interesting because they are emergent collective intelligence systems. They extract from the minds of the participants the value of goods and services, and they do so without any necessary leader or governing body. Participants don’t even need to be aware of the concept of a market in order for it to function.

If a market really values salt, then it will assign a high price to salt. People will then go out and find more salt in proportion to the price. If salt demand drops, so does the price, and then fewer people go out to mine it. The market allocates the ‘correct’ amount of human effort to salt procurement.

The market also indirectly incentivises whatever goes along with obtaining more salt. Salt demand may spawn new technologies, spur exploration, even start wars. But market forces are incredibly powerful. If production of some good causes immense environmental harm, or goes against the wishes of a government, but the market demands it, then it will be produced.

So markets allow people to specialise in large societies and respond dynamically to the priorities of people without organisational overhead. Markets are decentralised, value-signalling, resource-allocating systems.

But the market solution to the large-groups-of-people-specialising problem introduced a bunch of new problems.

How do you keep track of what things are worth? How many chickens is a pair of shoes worth? How many loaves of bread is a metal axe-head worth? Trying to keep track of all these conversions quickly becomes infeasible.

Figuring out conversion aside, in order for us to trade we need to have a coincidence of wants. If you make shoes, but all the bakers have good shoes already, how do you get your bread? If a baker wants shoes but you don’t need any bread then he better find another shoemaker who does.

Another issue is that most goods or services are not easily divisible. An axe-head may be worth 20 loaves of bread but you can’t divide the axe-head. And 20 loaves of bread won’t keep before you can eat them all.
