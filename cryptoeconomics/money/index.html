<h3 id="the-money-network">The Money Network</h3>
<p>A given money system is a big network consisting of people who use and believe in the money.</p>
<h4 id="money-as-ious">Money as IOUs</h4>
<p>When you go to your job and do some work, you contribute some actual value to the network, and in return you get some money.</p>
<p>This is basically an IOU from the network. The money itself doesn't have instrinsic value, but you can use it later to get something of real value from the network. So that cash you received is really just saying the network owes you X amount which you can redeem for whatever you want.</p>
<h4 id="reverse-ledger">Reverse Ledger</h4>
<p>Given that you have this big network of people who want to trade stuff with each other, one approach to keeping track of how much the network owes each person would be to maintain a big ledger. </p>
<p>There could be an entry for every person with their balance. This would be hard to maintain though.</p>
<p>Another approach is to use money. Money acts as a 'reverse ledger'. You don't have to keep track of names and balances, just let people trade the money.</p>
<h2 id="functions-of-money">Functions of Money</h2>
<p>The key functions of money are <strong>medium of exchange</strong>, <strong>unit of account</strong>, and <strong>store of value</strong>. If some material/medium/system can serve these functions, and gains enough confidence and use, then it is in principle as valid a form of money as any other.</p>
<h3 id="medium-of-exchange">Medium of Exchange</h3>
<p>Medium of exchange just means that the money serves as the thing that people trade in place of actual goods. </p>
<p>To be a good medium of exchange a money should be portable, durable, fungible (any dollar is just as good as any other), scarce, and easily divisible.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Rather than trading a pair of shoes for a chicken, you trade some money for the chicken and everyone else does the same.</p>
<h3 id="unit-of-account">Unit of Account</h3>
<p>Price everything in units of the money. So all goods and services are priced in terms of a common measure.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>This is the ability to say a chicken is worth X dollars, a pair of shoes is worth Y dollars, rather than saying a chicken is worth Z pairs of shoes. </p>
<h3 id="store-of-value">Store of Value</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>To act as a store of value, a money must be able to be reliably saved, stored, and retrievedâ€¦ (Wikipedia)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So your money should be able to hold value over time and then be used later.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Gold is good for store of value. Gold doesn't evaporate away and the supply doesn't inflate too much. People have valued it for thousands of years so it will probably remain valuable in 10 years or 50.</p>
<h2 id="fiat">Fiat</h2>
<p>Fiat is government-backed money. Usually a government will make it law that their fiat currency must be used for paying taxes, wages etc. and usually all businesses by law must accept fiat.</p>
<p>We tend to think of fiat as paper money, but something like 90% of the fiat money in circulation only exists as numbers in accounts/databases and has no physical counterpart. The digital portion still counts as being part of the same fiat supply.</p>
<p>Fiat has been criticised as being inflationary, and centralised.</p>
<h3 id="centralisation">Centralisation</h3>
<p>The amount of fiat that gets produced is controlled either directly by the government or kinda indirectly through a kinda separate entity like the Federal Reserve. </p>
<p>This organisation decides how much money will be produced, by whom, and in what manner (printing cash, <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/macroeconomics/monetary-system-topic/fractional-reserve-banking-tut/v/overview-of-fractional-reserve-banking">fractional lending</a>, etc).</p>
<p>This centralisation represents some risk as the controlling organisation may be attacked or become corrupt. They may produce too much money too quickly, and the country could suffer hyper-inflation. This has happened in Austria, China, Germany, Greece, Zimbabwe and many other countries.</p>
<h3 id="inflation">Inflation</h3>
<p>The US and Canada aim for something like 2% annual inflation. What this means is that if there is a total of <code>X</code> Canadian dollars in circulation right now, then one year from now there will be <code>X*1.02</code> total dollars in circulation. So the total supply of money is increasing constantly.</p>
<p>If you keep your money in a savings account you might get <code>.25%</code> interest or something like that, much less than the rate of inflation. So your money is devalued annually (relative to the total supply) by <code>1.75%</code>.</p>
<p>One way to look at this is that 1.75% of the value of your money is skimmed off every year and sent to the banks or whoever is issuing the new money.</p>
<h3 id="hyperinflation">Hyperinflation</h3>
<p>Hyperinflation occurs when, for whatever reason, the rate of inflation gets completely out of control.</p>
<p>Maybe the most well known example is in Zimbabwe where the Zimbabwe dollar (ZWL) went from:</p>
<pre><code>1.25 ZWL = 1 USD
</code></pre>

<p>to:</p>
<pre><code>688,000,000,000 ZWL = 1 USD
</code></pre>

<p>They had <strong>100 trillion</strong> dollar bills!</p>
