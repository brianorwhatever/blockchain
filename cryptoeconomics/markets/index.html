                <blockquote>
<p>A market is one of the many varieties of systems, institutions, procedures, social relations and infrastructures whereby parties engage in exchange (Wikipedia)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Market forces are more powerful than any government, corporation or other entity in the world. Markets are very much relevant to cryptocurrencies.</p>
<h2 id="examples-in-crypto">Examples in Crypto</h2>
<p>Bitcoin miners choose which transactions to include in their block based on the fees associated with the transactions. Pay a high fee and your transaction will get in. This is a market.</p>
<p>The decentralised internet will likely use a market system whereby your router routes packets based on the fee that they offer. In high demand periods the price per kilobyte will rise due to demand.</p>
<p>Golem will attempt to create a market for computation whereby computers can offer up their resources for a price and buyers (users of that computation) can purchase it.</p>
<p>Anywhere some kind of market exists cryptocurrencies may be able to bolster/redefine them. They will likely also ena ble entirely new markets to emerge.</p>
<h2 id="conceptualisation">Conceptualisation</h2>
<p>Typically one good/service is not exchanged directly for another, rather they are exchanged for money. So money, in whatever form, is the <strong>medium of exchange</strong> for a market. Money allows the market to fluidly operate.</p>
<p>Markets are meritorious, decentralised, resource allocating systems.</p>
<h3 id="decentralisation">Decentralisation</h3>
<p>They are decentralised in the sense that no one necessarily needs to oversee/control/govern the market in order for it to function. But even without a leader the market can intelligently allocate resources.</p>
<p>Our current systems in fact <em>do</em> have governing bodies precisely because we can't currently write our laws/rules into the "code" that defines the market because most markets exist in the physical world.</p>
<p>With cryptocurrencies we can make truly decentralised markets in the sense that the market rules are solidified into code and no governing body is needed at all to enforce those rules.</p>
<h3 id="resource-allocation">Resource allocation</h3>
<p>If the market assigns a high price to some good then people will be incented to obtain/produce more of that good. Material resources as well as human time and effort will be allocated to satisfying this demand in proportion to how highly the market values it.</p>
<p>So a market can be a way for people to collectively orchestrate themselves and direct their efforts toward whatever it is that they value. This is a bottom up approach to human coordination that is <em>much</em> stronger than top down.</p>
<h2 id="price">Price</h2>
<p>One of the things that markets do is price goods/services. The mechanism by which this is done is supply and demand. The market should determine the proper price for a good/service such that the 'correct' amount of effort/resources are allocated to producing it.</p>
<h3 id="pricing-accurately">Pricing Accurately</h3>
<p>Suppose you have a stock for some company in a stock market.</p>
<p>If all the participants in the market are aware of the company, understand what the company does, have familiarity with the companies publicly available accounting, and are aware of the company's direction and long term potential, then the market can accurately price the stock. </p>
<p>With complete information the market may still under or overvalue the stock due to the feedback loop nature of stock markets, but they will be much closer to the true value.</p>
<p>If however some/all participants are lacking information then the stock is very likely to be incorrectly priced.</p>
<h2 id="externalities">Externalities</h2>
<p>Sometimes producing a good/service will have some impact on another party that did not necessarily have a say in the exchange. Externalities may be 'unpriced' in the sense that the damage/benefit was not priced in when the transaction happened.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>The common example is pollution. Markets demand goods whose production pollutes the environment. People who had no part in the exchange may suffer the consequences of the pollution. It may also cost future generations huge amounts of money to fix. Neither of these were priced into the intial transaction.</p>
<h2 id="efficiency">Efficiency</h2>
<p>Markets are efficient in the sense that they price goods, and therefore allocate resources more 'accurately' than any individual or group could manage.</p>
<h2 id="free-markets">Free markets</h2>
<p>A free market is one in which buyers and sellers can establish the proper price for things naturally without government interference. Supply and demand should function properly, and no collusion, monopoly etc. should not take place.</p>
